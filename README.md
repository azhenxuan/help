## Status Update for Milestone 2

The progress of Project Help has been in-line with expectations. A demo of the
application (note that this is still a work-in-progress) is available [here](http://nus-help.herokuapp.com).
We have also prepared a [short video](https://youtu.be/3HfA9drTI4k) demonstrating 
the features available. As can be seen,  we have implemented the basic features, 
including IVLE login and simple adding and joining of modules is available. 

For the next milestone, we plan to work on two main areas, maintainability and 
usability.

### Maintability
Our current app and its code base is still small, and we were able to get this
far without writing a whole bunch of tests. However, to move beyond this point,
we feel that we would need to include a comprehensive set of tests to ensure we 
don't break our app while trying to improve it.

### Usability
During the past month, we have been overly focused on the technical aspects of 
building the app. At some point, we lost sight of users' needs. To fix this, we
plan to enlist some of our friends to test the app. We will then gather their
feedback on work on the problems they've identified, and perhaps include some
features they feel would be critical to the application's success.

## Introduction
A web-based help-session scheduler.

We are Team HELP, which comprises two BZA students, Zhen Xuan and Ken.
Our current target is Project Gemini, the intermediate level of achievement. The
main inspiration for this project was our daily struggle with schoolwork, and 
our inability to get timely help. 

Our solution is a web application where students can signal their need for 
assistance, before they fall deeper into CAP hell. Upon seeing the demand for
their services, TAs and Profs will (hopefully) start opening up time slots that
students can ballot for.  

## Team HELP
- Ang Zhen Xuan
- Ken Oung Yong Quan

## Scope of Project
### Target Groups
**Students:** Students in NUS who need extra face-time with TAs and Profs.

**Teaching Staff:** 
- TAs and Profs who want a platform to reach out to students who need more
help
- TAs and Profs who want a platform to coordinate help sessions

### Future Plans
Could see the scope of operations being expanded into other learning institutes
OR into corporate environments where employees want to schedule face-time with
higher-ups?

## Features
### Completed
1. (Student) Register for GetHelp sessions
2. (Users)   Set time slots for ProvideHelp sessions
3. (Student) Able to see schedule for GetHelp & ProvideHelp sessions for 
him/herself
4. (Student) Automatically display mods taken this sem 
5. (Student) Automatically filters irrelevant GetHelp sessions which provides
a cleaner view for users

### Next Sprint (Subject to change based on user feedback)
1. (Users)   Blacklist students that don't turn up
2. (Users)   Consult modal that shows details about the consult
3. (Student) Add feedback for help sessions

## User Stories
1. As a **Student**, I want to *register for help sessions*, so I can 
*arrange for consults easily*.
2. As a **User**, I want to *place help sessions up for registration*, so I can 
*provide help to students/peers who need it urgently*.
3. As a **Student**, I want to *have an easy schedule to refer to*, so I can
*save time checking back on my registered consults*.
4. As a **Student**, I want to *be able to see all the mods I'm taking* so I 
can *get started quickly without much setup needed*.
5. As a **User**, I want to *be able to blacklist students*, so I *won't have
to waste my time*.
6. As a **Student**, I want to *provide feedback on help sessions*, so I can 
*get better help from Profs and TAs next time*.
