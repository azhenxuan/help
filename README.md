# Project HELP

A web-based Q&A platform with a focus on image-based questions.

We are Team HELP, which is made up of two BZA student, Zhen Xuan and Ken.
Our current target is Project Gemini, the intermediate level of achievement. The
main inspiration for this project was our daily struggle with schoolwork, and 
our inability to get timely help. By adding image support to Q&A, we hope to 
create an easy-to-use platform for students to get quick detailed useful answers
to their questions.
