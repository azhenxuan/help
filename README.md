# Project HELP

A web-based help-session scheduler.

We are Team HELP, which comprises two BZA students, Zhen Xuan and Ken.
Our current target is Project Gemini, the intermediate level of achievement. The
main inspiration for this project was our daily struggle with schoolwork, and 
our inability to get timely help. 

Our solution is a web application where students can signal their need for 
assistance, before they fall deeper into CAP hell. Upon seeing the demand for
their services, TAs and Profs will (hopefully) start opening up time slots that
students can ballot for.  

## TODO:
1. Add exception for invalid tokens
2. Consultation Item Page

## Team HELP
- Ang Zhen Xuan
- Ken Oung Yong Quan

## Scope of Project
### Target Groups
**Students:** Students in NUS who need extra face-time with TAs and Profs.

**Teaching Staff:** 
- TAs and Profs who want a platform to reach out to students who need more
help
- TAs and Profs who want a platform to coordinate help sessions

### Future Plans
Could see the scope of operations being expanded into other learning institutes
OR into corporate environments where employees want to schedule face-time with
higher-ups?
